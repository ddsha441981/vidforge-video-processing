VidForge uses **FFmpeg** to perform all video editing and transformation tasks like trimming, merging, watermarking, etc.

### 🔧 Install FFmpeg

#### On Windows:
1. Download from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Extract and add the `bin` folder to your system `PATH`

#### On macOS (Homebrew):
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
